### 👋🏻 Hello!

I’m passionate about design since I was a little kid. I’m active, responsable and I always keep my eyes on small details. I’ve been working with Wordpress for 3+ years making responsive websites using visual editors like Elementor, WPBakery and Gutemberg. Sometimes, I’ve created shortcodes or I’ve modified little things from templates, but now I’m starting with React JS.

### 🎮 My Hobbies

I love illustrating, MMORPG videogames, music and tattoos. Also I spend my free time studying.
